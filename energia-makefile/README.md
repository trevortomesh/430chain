Energia MSP430 Makefile
-----------------------

I'm the kind of programmer that hates complicated IDEs, moreover I can't suffer Java(TM), for this reason I tend to use Makefiles to compile MCU code, this is what I've been doing with Arduino during the last years.

Yesterday I received this new Launchpad board and the very first thing I've done was to write a Makefile to compile and upload programs to the board.

This Makefile is freely adapted from the good job done by Tim Marston at http://ed.am/dev/make/arduino-mk

Makefile for c code
-------------------

Makefile.c is a makefile to compile c programs, it doesn't use energia stuff.
